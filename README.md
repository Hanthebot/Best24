I hate doing repetitive tasks, so I spent some time writing this website that does it for me.

# Issues:

Why does it calculate credit below 24? Such as 23?

- It's because I am currently not aware of the system deals with credits above 24, such as including a course with more than 1 credit. Once I am aware of it, I will update it. Or, you can help contribute to it.

# Contributing:
Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

Also explain what changes you have made, so I can learn from it too!
